# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
- **Never commit credentials to version control**
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate your Google API credentials
- Use the principle of least privilege for OAuth scopes

### Authentication
- Use OAuth 2.0 for user authentication when possible
- Service accounts should only be used for server-to-server scenarios
- Store refresh tokens securely and never expose them in logs
- Enable automatic token refresh to maintain security

### Network Security
- Always use HTTPS/TLS for API communications
- Validate all SSL certificates
- Implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- File uploads are restricted by size and type
- API responses are properly parsed and validated

## Reporting a Vulnerability
